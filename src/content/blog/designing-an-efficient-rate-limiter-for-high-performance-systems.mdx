Systems break down under tremendous load, and we need to ensure that it doesnâ€™t happen

### Key Objectives

A well-constructed rate limiter should achieve the following goals:

- **Limit Requests:** Control the number of incoming requests within a specified timeframe.
- **Granular Configuration:** Empower developers with the flexibility to configure thresholds at a granular level.
  Minimal Overhead: Ensure that the rate limiter implementation does not introduce significant additional overhead.

### Understanding the Rate Limiter

---

The rate limiter functions as the initial defense mechanism for incoming requests. It follows a straightforward process:

- The Rate limiter is the first line of defense
- Any incoming request is first consulted against the rate limiter
- If we are under limits, let the request pass-through
- Otherwise, reject the request with Error **[429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429)** (Too many requests)

### Implementation as a Library

---

Rather than conceiving the rate limiter as a standalone service, we propose implementing it as a library. This approach centralizes the business logic within a dedicated library, providing a cleaner and more modular solution.

By encapsulating the rate limiter within a library, developers gain a seamless way to integrate this crucial functionality into their applications.

### Scaling the Redis Database

---

When considering the scalability of the underlying database, such as Redis, two primary approaches can be explored:

- **Vertical Scaling:** Enhance the performance of the existing database server by upgrading its resources.
- **Sharding:** Distribute the database load by adding shards, enabling horizontal scaling.
  By strategically implementing these scaling strategies, the rate limiter can efficiently manage increasing workloads while maintaining optimal performance.
